# MGSA-Roguelike-Terminals

As part of the [RogueDOTS](https://github.com/LazyGameDevZA/RogueDOTS) package I'm developing I had built a console renderer using Unity's Tilemap and Pixel Perfect Camera. This Repo contains a project that demonstrates very basic usage of the Tilemap editor, but also how a Tilemap can be manipulated programmatically with the aim on rendering something similar to a terminal.

## 01. Tilemap

Shows basic usage of the tilemap and how it's useful for creating 2D tile based levels.

## 02. Pixel Perfect Renderer

Consists of 2 scenes:

1. WithoutRenderer
2. WithRenderer

WithoutRenderer shows artifacts that get generated by an incorrect camera size.

WithRenderer shows how the camera better handles pixelart

## 03. Programmatic Tilemap

Consists of 2 scenes:

1. ProgrammaticTilemap
2. FinalDemo

ProgrammaticTilemap shows how Tiles can be constructed programmatically and "drawn" on a Tilemap.

FinalDemo is a special demo to close off the presentation.
